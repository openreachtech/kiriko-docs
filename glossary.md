# Glossary

## Kiriko

Kiriko is a protocol that enables real-time onchain exams.

## kiriko.wtf

kiriko.wtf refers to the interface "kiriko.wtf," which is one of the client implementations of the Onchain Examination Protocol, Kiriko.

## Onchain Examination Protocol

The Onchain Examination Protocol is a permissionless protocol based on smart contracts that allows anyone to create any number of exams. Through the Exam Factory Contract, various types of exams can be created on the blockchain.

## Examination SubDAOs

Examination SubDAOs are DAOs that create questions for specific fields using the Onchain Examination Protocol. While anyone can create exams permissionlessly, having organizations dedicated to creating high-quality exams consistently is preferable. We aim to build multiple SubDAOs operating on the Onchain Examination Protocol.

## Kiriko Ecosystem

The Kiriko Ecosystem consists of:
- Core protocol (Onchain Examination Protocol)
- Client applications (e.g., kiriko.wtf)
- Examination SubDAOs

The Core Protocol is a permissionless, open, and free smart contract available for anyone to reference.

While kiriko.wtf is a client application, it is theoretically possible to launch multiple clients specializing in specific exams.

Examination SubDAOs are crucial for the long-term development of the Kiriko ecosystem, enabling the creation of new decentralized exams in various fields.

## Examiner

An examiner is someone who creates onchain exams. Anyone can freely create and publish exams. The examiner must record the answers in the contract in advance, ensuring that cheating is not possible.

## Examinee

An examinee is someone who takes the onchain exams. Examinees can take exams of their choice at their discretion. During the exam period, examinees can overwrite their answers as many times as they want until they are satisfied. After the exam ends, examinees can see how they compare to others who took the same exam and, if they pass, receive an onchain digital certificate.

## Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)

EAS is a digital certificate issued on the blockchain. The contents of the EAS certificate are highly customizable, and the examiner can design the contents of the certificate in advance. EAS can be described as a mechanism that attaches a digital signature to structured information.

## Decentralized Society (DeSoc)

In the real world, economic activities are based on sustainable trust relationships formed within society. Decentralized Society aims to realize such a network based on trust in the crypto world. By accumulating "Soul" on addresses and forming an onchain persona, communities can gather bottom-up, using their creativity to co-create various network assets and intelligence at multiple scales, enabling the construction of a pluralistic society.

## Soulbound Token (SBT)

A Soulbound Token (SBT) is an NFT that cannot be transferred to other addresses. It creates an onchain activity history by representing the user's identity, achievements, and attendance.

Currently, the specifications are not finalized, and multiple entities are experimenting with its use.

## Public goods

Public goods are resources that everyone within the ecosystem can use and that benefit society as a whole. Public goods play a crucial role in spreading the benefits of technology in the crypto world. In the Ethereum and broader crypto ecosystem, examples of public goods include open-source projects, documentation, and educational materials.

Take [Gitcoin](https://www.gitcoin.co/) as an example. This project establishes a system to financially support open-source developers who create essential tools for crypto, such as wallets and explorers, as a community. Without such a mechanism, the convenient tools we use daily might not have existed.

Even if a tool cannot generate business profits on its own, if it is beneficial to many people, there needs to be a mechanism to support it and a community mindset that encourages public goods.
