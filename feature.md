## Competitive Environment

Kiriko is a protocol for online exams that allows multiple participants to compete simultaneously.

Unlike typical onchain exams where the test ends once someone finds the correct answer, Kiriko allows participants to submit answers multiple times within the time limit. The smart contract records who submitted answers and when, ensuring the order of submission. Additionally, measures are in place to prevent cheating by ensuring that participants cannot view each other's answers.

## Seamless Onchain Process - No Trust Anchor Needed

In traditional online exams, there is a risk that questions and answers could be changed by the examiner after the exam begins, answers submitted by the examinees could be tampered with, and online certificates could be falsified, necessitating trust in the exam and certificate issuing authorities.

With Kiriko, everything from the exam questions to answer submission and certificate issuance is recorded onchain. Once the examiner publishes the questions and answers, it is possible to prove that a participant has passed the exam entirely onchain without needing to trust any specific third party.

This groundbreaking system eliminates the need to rely on the authority of exam execution agencies or digital certificate issuing bodies, allowing evaluation based on the content and results of the exams.

## Formation of High-Quality Communities

Proving knowledge and skills enables the formation of communities onchain, composed of individuals proficient in specific fields. This protocol can also be used within existing communities as a means of verifying knowledge.
