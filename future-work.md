# Future Work

## Increase in Examination SubDAOs

The development of Kiriko heavily relies on the growth of SubDAOs that offer a diverse range of exams. We aim to create various SubDAOs, such as those for English exams, Solidity exams, or exams testing knowledge of specific projects. Donations and sponsor budgets received by Kiriko, being a public good, will be redistributed to these SubDAOs.

## DAOization of the Core Protocol

In the long term, Kiriko's operations will be conducted as a DAO, allowing for decentralized funding distribution to SubDAOs. This will make the certification exams and the associated trust-building infrastructure completely democratic, eliminating political corruption in the trust-building process.

## Multi-Chain Support

Supporting well-known L2s such as Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and Base will make it easier for projects within each chain to utilize Kiriko's system.

kiriko.wtf will provide a user-friendly UI that supports multi-chain functionality.

## Enhancement of Peripheral Tools

We will build a Kiriko-compliant EAS Explorer to display digital certificates such as passing certificates issued as EAS for each address.

Additionally, we will prepare an Exam Incentive Contract in line with Kiriko's Core Protocol, enabling not only the issuance of EAS but also the distribution of tokens like ERC20 and ERC721 to top performers.
