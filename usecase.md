## Interoperability of Digital Certificates from Onchain Exams

By ensuring that only users who have proven their knowledge can use a service, the target audience for the service becomes clearer.

## Formation of High-Quality Communities on a Project Basis

Nowadays, new projects often incentivize users to follow their social media or participate in testnets to gather support.
