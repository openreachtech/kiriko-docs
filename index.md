# Welcome to Kiriko - Onchain Examination Protocol

## Welcome

Kiriko - Onchain Examination Protocol is an open-source public good project that enables exams on the blockchain.

How do you verify who has what knowledge in the world of the internet? In the modern online space, while rapidly advancing AI technology makes acquiring knowledge easier, proving that an individual actually possesses that knowledge remains a challenge. We need a common standard to prove the knowledge and skills people have.

Additionally, in the Web3 world, there is a movement towards forming personalities on the blockchain to enable decentralized social activities.

Kiriko is a standardized application base layer for conducting exams on the blockchain to prove that individuals have acquired knowledge and skills. Through Kiriko, anyone can create exams without permission and prove their knowledge and skills without relying on third-party institutions through onchain exams. Furthermore, by visualizing an individual's knowledge proficiency on the blockchain, it contributes to the formation of onchain personalities.

## The trend of Exam and Attestation

![attestation-history](../images/attestation-history.gif)

Let's look back at the flow of proving knowledge through exams.

First, educational institutions like universities have traditionally issued paper graduation certificates and transcripts. Many current certificates still follow this format. (Phase 1)

Next, there have been efforts to issue certificates viewable online. Services like [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) offer online degrees and course completion certificates. (Phase 2)

In the context of the blockchain, the [Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)](https://attest.org/) provides a protocol that allows certificates to be issued for onchain and offchain matters. In the future, specific institutions might use EAS to bring offchain test results onto the blockchain as certificates. (Phase 3)

With Kiriko, we aim to take it to the next phase by enabling the entire exam process to be completed onchain, completely eliminating the need to trust third-party institutions. (Phase 4) Smart contracts ensure that exam questions and answers are tamper-proof, and the digital certificates obtained through the exams are clearly linked to the results.

## Why Onchain Matters

The reason we emphasize conducting exams onchain is that we believe the concept of a Decentralized Society (DeSoc) outlined in [Vitalik Buterin](https://x.com/VitalikButerin)'s paper [Decentralized Society: Finding Web3's Soul](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763) will become mainstream in the future of the internet.

In DeSoc, accumulating Soul on the blockchain forms the onchain persona for that address.

In the crypto world, the trustless concept centered around decentralized financial services has been common. However, with the formation of onchain personas, diverse economic activities based on trust can become possible within the crypto world.

For example, while DeFi lending requires over-collateralization due to its trustless nature, in the real world, banks lend based on a person's credit information (name, address, employer, etc.).

In the crypto world, which is fundamentally based on the principle of "Don't Trust," if trust can be formed on the blockchain based on an individual's onchain activity history, complex services based on that trust will emerge one after another.

Kiriko aims to fill the necessary parts for DeSoc from the educational perspective, making it possible to assess what knowledge an individual possesses solely on the blockchain. This can be useful for anonymous hiring activities and forming high-quality communities on the blockchain.

We believe the future of crypto lies beyond DeSoc. Therefore, Kiriko is committed to being fully onchain while providing a permissionless public good service that anyone can use.

## Key Things to Know About Kiriko

### Kiriko creates onchain persona

The blockchain is said to be the next online space. Kiriko contributes to forming an individual's persona on the blockchain. Kiriko enables a system that relatively evaluates the extent of knowledge in various fields on the blockchain.

### Kiriko is a part of shaping Desoc

Beyond the formation of onchain personas lies DeSoc. In the blockchain world, which is fundamentally trustless, a societal structure based on trust can be built. Kiriko contributes to the accumulation of trust in addresses from an educational perspective.

### Kiriko is a public good

The concept of Public Good refers to something convenient for everyone. Kiriko's smart contracts are permissionless and can be used by anyone. Moreover, creating exams does not incur any fees, so it can be used for free. Our service is continuously improved thanks to many generous sponsors.

### Kiriko is a community building tool

Proving knowledge can help form high-quality communities. Kiriko's onchain exams can be used as part of project education within communities, and analyzing onchain exam results can help form new communities with people who share similar interests.

### kiriko.wtf is a first client

We will implement kiriko.wtf as the first client application utilizing the Kiriko protocol.
